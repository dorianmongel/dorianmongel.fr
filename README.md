# Static website builder

Developed in php, this builder allows to generate a static site from tickets written in markdown. A "drafts" folder allows you to write pending posts and the "posts" folder allows you to publish articles, in antechronological order according to the name of the markdown file. 

The aim of this project is to publish a blog supported by Netlify containing a new post every day that has been pushed with git.
